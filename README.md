### The notebook is viewed in a better way in jupyter (Output scrolling enabled) compared to Github , as we dont have to scroll through continuously. Some of the outputs like the tokenized word ranking printed are really long.  
 
### It takes sometime for the notebook to load in github , due to long outputs. Sometimes, I had to reload the page when i get the error ' Unable to render notebook ' in github. It would be great if you could please download and check locally.

Please update the import statements according to the tensorflow and keras you have in your system, to run the notebook
For example, in my case it is 'from tensorflow import keras', while for others , this may throw an error, so, use 'import keras'
